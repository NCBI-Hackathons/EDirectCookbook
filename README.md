**If there are things you want to be able to do with EDirect, but can't figure out how, you can ask the community for help by creating an Issue. See below, under "How to contribute," for more information.**

**To install EDirect, follow the instructions in ["Entrez Direct: E-utilities on the Unix Command Line"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)**

## How to contribute

You can contribute to this page through GitHub. (If you are not already viewing the GitHub version of this page, please click the "View on GitHub" button at the top of the page.)  Using GitHub, you can create Issues or Pull Requests to contribute to the cookbook.

### Create an Issue to:

* Request an EDirect script to accomplish a task, citing specific use cases
* Present a non-working EDirect script and ask for a fix
* Identify non-working scripts listed below
	
### Create a Pull Request to:

* Add a working EDirect script to the list below
* Modify or optimize an EDirect script listed below
* Update the "Confirmed by:" date/version of a listed EDirect script with confirmation that it is still valid
	
## Best Practices for EDirect:

* Please keep to <50,000 expected hits (it simply wonâ€™t work)
* Please do not run from multiple processors on a compute farm

## EDirect Scripts


### Get all SRA runs for a given BioProject 
Description (optional):  
Written by: Bob Sanders (3/22/2017)  
Confirmed by:  
Databases: SRA, BioProject 

```
esearch -db bioproject -query "PRJNA356464" | elink -target sra | efetch -format docsum | \
xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -ACC @acc -block DocumentSummary -element "&ACC"
```

### Get latitiude and longitude for SRA Datasets (e.g. outbreaks and metagenomes)
Description (optional):  
Written by: BB, Mike D, Rob Edwards (4/12/2017)  
Confirmed by:  
Databases: SRA, BioSample 

```
for i in $(cat sra_ids.txt); do ll=$(esearch -db sra -query $i | \
elink -target biosample | efetch -format docsum | \
xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -block Attribute -if Attribute@attribute_name -equals lat_lon -element Attribute); \
echo -e "$i\t$ll"; done
```

### Get run sizes (in bp) for SRA Datasets
Description (optional): This retrieves the SRR id and the size in bp of the run from a file (`ids.txt`) of SRR IDs. You can also change `bases` to `size_MB`to get the size of the dataset in MB. _Question: Does the size in MB include the sequence identifiers (i.e. the size of the file) or just the sequences?_
